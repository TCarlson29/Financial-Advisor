# Tanner and Cuong's Project Plan
# Financial Advisor


## Description
* A web/mobile application that uses recorded personal spending habits and incomes to create a manageable financial plan. 

## Learning Goals
* Front-end development with React/Node/Vue/etc.
* Server implementations in Java or some other PLs
* Money handling skills and algorithms
* Back-end development with new PLs (Rust, etc.)

## Feature Goals
* Essential
    * OCR implementation and pages to manually enter past income and expenses
    * Show a chart of percentage expenses by expense category
    * Server to hold expense data
    * Dashboard for navigation
* Nice-to-Have
    * Automatically calculate supposed wealth and compare it to a user statement of wealth to alert for unaccounted incomes/expenditures
    * Comparison to a statistic based/user desired normal expense chart, and highlight overspending/underspending per category.
    * Calculators to simulate future wealth if investments are made (stocks, savings, etc.)
    * Login/Account feature using server
* Stretch
    * Web-scraping for stock information to recommend investment options with liquid assets
    * Chatbot companion to help navigate the app

* Dashboard with feature buttons
* Page for each feature
* Expense data server
* Nice-to-Have
    * Login screen
    * Server to hold login/account information
    * Other feature buttons from Nice-to-Have

## Development Schedule
* Discussing data specificity/what data we want to measure
* OCR implementation (parallel1) (by week 4)
* Chart development (parallel1) (by week 4)
* Data server (parallel2) (by week 7)
* Dashboard (UI) (parallel2) (by week 7)
* Nice-to-Have (if time)
    * Dashboard additions from Nice-to-Have features
    * Login/Account server
    * Better UI (light/dark mode) (parallel to everything)

## Concerns
* SCALE
* Finding or coming up with data, algorithms, etc. 
* UI development
* Find APIs to pull accurate spending and investment data (for stretch goal)

## Communication Plan
* Preferred method of communication is Slack
* Meet weekly or biweekly to discuss plans for the week/pair programming
* Meet before/after class briefly

## Contribution Plan
* Sit next to each other in class to feel the resentment from the other person
* Discuss weekly contributions during meeting times
* Add more to this plan as the term progresses
