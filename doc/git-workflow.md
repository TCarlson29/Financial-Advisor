# Git Workflow

## Branching

* We decided that whenever we are trying to work on something new we would branch from the main; evident by our already existing 5 branches. It just makes everything easier so that the already existing main branch can keep our working directory clean. It can also help with merge conflicts because we both are working in separate branches.

## Merging

* We decided that merging would happen when we get a section of the project working. This can be basic changes or larger additions to the project. We have been using the Github Pull request feature to merge the branches into main and even merge main into other branches to continue to work on them with merges from other branches. This has been working so far and we haven't encountered any merge conflicts or other errors that have been noticeable.

## Code Review

* We decided that we would code review mmost of the important aspects before we merge so that we can both understand what the code is doing. The partner that has been working on the branch the most should lead the code review and help the other understand and answer any questions (that they can) about the code.
