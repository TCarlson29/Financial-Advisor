# Short Description
This project is meant to provide a series of services that help the user in using their money effectively, such as noting how they have spent their money across various categories. By the end of the term, we hope to have added enough functionalities that it's actually helpful to use rather than being left behind as a class project of days past.

# Status
Has working input and records of personal expenses and savings calculation plan, as well as the budgeting page that shows if one has spent more than expected on something.

The graphs that visualize the stats are not working, and cool features like OCR or voice input have not even been started on.

# Run the App
See the running.md doc in the same 'doc' folder as this file.

# Questions
* Are the functions so far intuitive/convenient to use? How can we improve them?
* Any cool idea that we can try to implement?
* Is the current coloring too garish or something along that line? What would be a nice color scheme?
